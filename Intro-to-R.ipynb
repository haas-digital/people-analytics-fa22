    "### What is R?\n",
    "\n",
    "[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language- a way for us to communicate with the computer and give it instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any language, R has a vocabulary made up of words it can understand, and a syntax giving the rules for how to structure communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like natural human languages, R has rules. It differs from natural language in two important ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The rules are simple. You can learn most of them in a few weeks and gain reasonable proficiency with the language in a few months.\n",
    "    The rules are rigid. If you're proficient in a natural language, you can understand a non-proficient speaker, glossing over small mistakes. A computer running R code is not smart enough to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to learn a few of those rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use R?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a programming language, R makes it possible to perform complex analyses on large datasets in a way that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- repeatable: you can use the same code (with minor changes) to do the same analysis on different data\n",
    "- fast: a lot of code to perform common analysis operations has already been created for you to use without writing it yourself\n",
    "- free: the software is open source and usable by anyone at no cost\n",
    "\n",
    "R is commonly used for business and research, particularly in fields like finance, economics, and statistics. If you are planning to work in the business world, it's very possible that you will work with R or that you will work with someone who programs in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><b>What about Excel/Python/SAS/etc? </b> Common analytics tasks can be done using a variety of programming languages and software, which raises a natural question- which one should you use? Generally, no single language is the \"best\". Your choice will often depend on:\n",
    "<ul><li>type of task: R was designed for statistical analysis, so it is well tested and documented for that purpose. Others have different specialties (e.g. Python and machine learning)</li>\n",
    "    <li> size of dataset: Excel has been known to run into problems for big dataset (more than 1 million rows)</li>\n",
    "    <li> location: many companies and fields have a predominant software used by most people in their community. It's a lot easier to collaborate when you all speak the same language </li></ul>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The good news is that once you are \"fluent\" in one, it becomes much easier to pick up another.\n",
