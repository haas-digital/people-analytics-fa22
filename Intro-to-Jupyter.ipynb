    "1. **re-run your code cells**: if you get an \"object '___' not found\" error under a code cell, you may have forgotten to run a cell above it. Try re-running previous cells in order, from top to bottom, or go to the Cell menu and click \"Run all\" or \"Run all above\".\n",

    "4. **restart your server**: if all else fails, try clicking \"Control Panel\" at the top right, then click \"Stop my server\" followed by \"Start my server\". Like restarting your kernel, this will require you to re-run any code cells you had already executed.\n",
