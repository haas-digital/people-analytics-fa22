Classification is a type of Machine Learning where we identify which set of categories a person or observation might belong to. We use a set of \"training\" data containing observations whose category is known and then build a model to make judgements about what classification we might put other people (or instances) into. Classification is an example of pattern recognition, we look for patterns in the data to help us predict what future patterns might be.* \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **re-run your code cells**: if you get an \"object '___' not found\" error under a code cell, you may have forgotten to run a cell above it. Try re-running previous cells in order, from top to bottom, or go to the Cell menu and click \"Run all\" or \"Run all above\".\n",
    "2. **try a different browser**: either Firefox or Chrome should work with minimal issues.\n",
    "3. **restart your notebook kernel**: the \"kernel\" is the program that runs Jupyter. Restart it by going to the Kernel menu and clicking \"Restart\". Note: this will make Jupyter \"forget\" any commands you previously gave it; you will need to re-run previously run code cells.\n",
    "4. **restart your server**: if all else fails, try clicking \"Control Panel\" at the top right, then click \"Stop my server\" followed by \"Start my server\". Like restarting your kernel, this will require you to re-run any code cells you had already executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also several resources available to help you at any time:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Your classmates**: it's not uncommon for students to enter this course with some familiarity with programming, R, and/or Jupyter.\n",
    "* **Your course reader**: reach out to Daniela Perez via email or bCourses with questions on programming and Jupyter.\n",

See their schedule and attend a consultation at [https://data.berkeley.edu/ds-peer-consulting](https://data.berkeley.edu/ds-peer-consulting).\n",

However, the data and the problem are structured very similarly to how actual companies such as IBM are approaching this very real problem. In analytics, the focus of the problem, study, or experiment is often called the <b>response</b>, <b>explanatory</b>, or the <b>dependent</b> variable.
