Employee attrition refers to a decrease in employees at a company, caused by resignations, retirements, or the elimination of job positions. It is important for businesses to anticipate attrition so they can keep costs low and properly distribute workloads.

In this module, student will analyze different logistic regression models built to predict whether or not an employee will leave their job using a mock data set created by IBM. 

This module is designed for students with no previous programming experience.
